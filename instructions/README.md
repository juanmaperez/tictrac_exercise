# Web Developer Test

## Brief

Using the provided HTML skeleton you will be required to replicate the given design.

## Prerequisites

- Build process is already in place (webpack)
- Local server with hot-reloading can be started using `npm start`.
- Sass compilation is in place via webpack.

## Tasks

You will need to:

1. Replicate the design, paying close attention to detail.
2. Ensure itâ€™s responsive between mobile and desktop with a toggleable menu on mobile.
3. Consume the include `tweets.js` file and display the **latest 5 tweets** on the page under the header in the style shown in the design across mobile and desktop.
4. Links should be clickable as in the design.
5. Show the created date in relative format (e.g 5 days ago).
6. Implement a preference toggle that will allow the user to change between absolute and relative dates by default. Changing the toggle will update all displayed tweets instantly and this change should persist on page refresh.

## Notes

- Avoid using CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap.
- Feel free to use JS frameworks or packages you are comfortable with.
